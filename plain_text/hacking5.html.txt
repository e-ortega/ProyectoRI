HackThisSite is now SSL-enabled !  We've done the best we can to ensure nothing will cause a half-secure connection (some non-SSL items loading), but some things still might.  If you encounter any half-secure connections (excluding embedded images in forums posts), please be sure to submit a bug report .    read more... | comments (2)          05/02/12: It's Gameday! .. But With Laws      We at HackThisSite hope everyone enjoys the Superbowl today and can safely overcome their #FirstWorldProblems of determining which dip they should prepare for which chip.  However, in light of recent copyright law awareness, we wish to remind everyone that, pursuant to 17 USC 1 § 110 (5)(B)(i)(II) , watching the Superbowl on a screen larger than 55 inches and/or using more than four speakers in one room for its audio constitutes a public performance and is thereby copyright infringement if not properly licensed -- not to mention merely having friends over to watch it also is a violation, regardless of screen size or speaker count.  So go enjoy the big game.. ..just, uhh, by yourself on a small screen with two speakers.    read more... | comments (2)          05/02/12: SOPA/PIPA Shelved, Still More To Fight      Over two weeks ago, both SOPA and PIPA were shelved .  However, "shelved" does not imply "dead."  Shelved simply implies that the Internet was so loud in their dissent of these atrocious bills, it would be political suicide to continue them any further .. for now.  What is truly sad is that it took this level of an Internet blackout to even reach Congress.  SOPA's sponsor, Lamar Smith (R-TX) went so far as to call SOPA opponents "a vocal minority" , and later casting them as piracy harbingers for merely protesting against this bill, nevermind poor legal language (which, in the same sentence, he claimed such language did not exist, demanding opponents "[s]how [him] the language. There’s nothing they can point to that does what they say it does do").  Even worse is that this was simply one of many unending steps by the media industry.  If they can't have SOPA/PIPA, then they'll force treaties to bind Congress's hands, constituency be damned.  With wave two of this bulls...    read more... | comments (0)          19/01/12: Blackout Wednesday: Successful, But Not Over Yet      Less than 24 hours after the SOPA/PIPA blackout protest, the effects are already quite visible: 19 Senators have thus far dropped support for PIPA; 8 million people used Wikipedia's utility to look up their elected officials' contact information; Google collected 4.5 million petition signatures only halfway through the protest; other websites invoked hundreds of thousands more people into action; and Jon Stewart laid into Congress on the absurdity of their actions with SOPA.  However, the fight to protect information and Internet freedom is far from over.  It is quite saddening that, on the very same day of the protest, the United States Supreme Cou...    read more... | comments (6)          16/01/12: SOPA -almost- dead, PIPA still alive      Word is out on the street that US House Representative Eric Cantor (R-VA) has "effectively kill[ed]" SOPA .  Upon further reading, though, Representative Cantor has done nothing more than delayed when SOPA will reach the House floor until "issues are addressed".  Please note, SOPA is not dead move forward with bringing PIPA to the Senate floor censoring itself Wikipedia itself use our censorship template read more... | comments (1)    Current Online Users: ( 26 Users, 226 Guests, 252 Total; 1995 Most Ever )  Abysmabad - afrotintin - aljazperc - ayaflux - cheezsh - coopcookie - DubKill_SwAg - gh05-7 - GoldenHacker69 - itsbecauseimsexy - jaxmirage - kyle2212 - McCoyPauley - mrbi - Mr_Void - NateFU21 - OldOne - perdicks - Rahatrubi - razul000 - riptide45 - ski11t3ch - vikki9 - wan26 - wkaid - wwar  Newest User : jaxmirage (Joined 2 minutes 3 seconds ago)   HackThisSite is is the collective work of the HackThisSite staff, licensed under a CC BY-NC license.
