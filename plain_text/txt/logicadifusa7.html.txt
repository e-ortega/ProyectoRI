Han podido ver sus lavadoras u otros electrodomésticos que dicen "FUZZY LOGIC?" Habitualmente las premisas de la lógica que conocemos tienen sólo dos extremos: o son completamente ciertas o son totalmente falsas (1 v 0). En el mundo de la lógica difusa las premisas pueden tener un grado de certeza que le permite acercar la matemática al lenguaje impreciso del hombre común, ya que está repleto de términos vagos como “poco”, “mucho”, “tibio”, etc. Entonces podemos decir que la lógica difusa analiza los métodos y principios del razonamiento a partir de proposiciones IMPRECISAS similar a como lo haría un ser humano: "Si hace algo de frio y tengo muchas cosas que hacer entonces no salgo ", ¿Cuánto es algo o mucho ? De esa manera tu lavadora puede decirdir cuanto tiempo lavar, cuanto detergente pedir, y cuanta agua cargar, con reglas de inferencias del tipo: Si la ropa esta muy sucia , y el agua es fria , y ademas hay mucha ropa -> cargar mucha agua y lavar durante mucho tiempo. :P Para los q quieren saber mas... Un sistema difuso convencional consta de 3 etapas que son las siguientes: Fuzzyficación Consiste en llevar los valores del mundo real al ambiente Fuzzy mediante el uso de funciones de membresía. Por ejemplo, si tenemos un paciente con fiebre, podemos plantear un modelo en el que la situación de fiebre no se restringe sólo a dos valores (hay fiebre o no hay fiebre), sino que tenemos todo un rango de temperaturas posible, asi un paciente que tiene 38C de tempratura puede tener fiebre como no tenerla pero en cierto grado. Inferencia Lógica Para poder operar con los Conjuntos Difusos es necesario definir las operaciones elementales entre ellos. Esto implica definir el modo de calcular las funciones de pertenencia a estos tres conjuntos. Siento FP una función que nos devuelve el grado de pertenencia al un conjunto difuso, Zadeh propone: FP(X AND Y) = mínimo de (FP (X), FP(Y)) FP (X OR Y) = máximo de (FP (X), FP (Y)) NOT FP = 1 – FP (X), considerando pertenencia total = 1 En realidad, estas expresiones son bastante arbitrarias y podrían haberse definido de muchas otras maneras. En la actualidad se considera correcto definir el operador AND mediante cualquier aplicación t-norma y el operador OR mediante cualquier aplicación s-norma. Defuzzyficación Después de calcular las reglas fuzzy y evaluar las variables fuzzy, necesitaremos trasladar estos valores nuevamente hacia el mundo real. El método más popular de defusificación es el cálculo del centro de gravedad ó centroide, el cual retorna el centro del área bajo la curva de la inferencia. El término difuso aplicado a la lógica procede de la expresión fuzzy sets (conjuntos difusos) acuñada por Lofti A. Zadeh. Zadeh prefirió el término fuzzy para denominar a sus conjuntos y a la lógica en la que se apoya su análisis. Uno de los países donde más éxito han tenido los sistemas difusos ha sido en Japón. Empresas como Fuji Elec.& TIT han desarrollado aplicaciones de control fuzzy para el proceso de purificación del agua, Hitachi con una aplicación de control fuzzy para el Metro en Sendai City o Matsushita con una aplicación de control fuzzy para la unidad de suministro de agua caliente para uso doméstico. Merece una mención especial la creación de LIFE (Laboratory for International Fuzzy Engineering Research) en marzo de 1989, creado por el Ministerio de Comercio Internacional e Industria en Japón (MITI). Pero también en USA las empresas han comenzado a aplicar la lógica difusa a sus desarrollos y proyectos. Entre otras encontramos a la NASA, Boeing, Rochwell, Bell o a Ford Motor Co., que experimenta con un sistema de aparcamiento automático para camiones con remolque.

dijo...   Once upon a time air travel was a great deal simpler than it is today. You called one of a few airlines that flew from your airport, the agent would tell you what flights were available for a given time, and you booked the one you wanted. Airports were always bustling places, especially during the holidays, but as long as you gave yourself adequate time, the process was usually the same. You would check your bags, go through the x-ray machine, get your boarding pass, and wait patiently at the appropriate gate. Once you got on the plane you ate the snack or meal that came with your flight and watched a movie. In recent years travel by plane has become significantly more complicated. There are so many different configurations for flights and types of fares. Dire economic circumstances have caused airlines to raise rates and charge extra fees for everything from baggage to blankets. There are complex rules about what you can and cannot carry in your luggage. It can be very difficult to determine whether you are getting the best deal or the best services when you buy an airline ticket. The internet makes the navigation of airlines, airports, and flight itineraries easier, but, even so, be prepared to do some research if you want to find a flight at the best price. Here is something up front that might save you time and money right off the bat. If you are traveling within the United States mainland, always look at Southwest Airlines first. Southwest is almost always the best deal you will find. However, Southwest itineraries do not appear on the major travel websites, so always go directly to the airline's website for information. Plug in your travel plans, and you will get a list of all the flights that are available. Southwest typically charges more reasonable prices than other airlines, and there are no hidden fees. The price you see is the price you get although tax and the government fee that is attached to all flights does apply. For lower prices than you can probably get anywhere else look at the "web only" fares, but keep in mind that these fares are not refundable.

dijo...   Playing bingo needs more than luck or skills and techniques, contrary to what most believe. Bingo, just like any game of chance, comes with rules and regulations that players should observe. Being a player comes with responsibilities and etiquette. Winning the Game The moment you figured out you won, you must immediately yell BINGO, and it should be loud enough for the floor walker to hear. The pot money shall be given to the winner once their winning card is confirmed. Well, in winning or once you know you just won, the most important thing is that you shout the winning word BEFORE the time elapses. If the game proceeds and the next number is mentioned and you failed to shout "Bingo", your winning card is disqualified. Therefore, this is the rule you must know. There may be cases when there are two winners, and in this case the pot money shall be divided equally among the winners. Supposing there are two winning cards, the two winners will share half the prize money. Bingo Game Rules Bingo rules are basically the same no matter in which Online Bingo hall you play. But still it's good if you know these rules by heart. If it is your first try, then ask for handouts and inquire from pros regarding the game rules. Nonetheless, the ideal thing to do if you have questions is to ask the floor walker and not the person seated beside you. You should clarify things and doubts before the game starts because asking too many questions as the game proceeds could well distract you. This guideline also applies to those who are newcomers at casinos, those who play roulette for the first time. Bingo halls demand an age limit of 18 years old. If you are below this age, you are prohibited to play. Some bingo houses ban alcohol inside, so players aren't supposed to take liquor nor drink it inside the venue. Smoking may also be restricted inside the venue, as there are designated smoking sections. Take note that some Bingo houses don't allow food but some do, so it basically depends on the venue. Policies vary among different venues. For instance, some bingo halls allow reservation of cards, while others don't allow it. Some allow people to leave the venue in the middle of the game, others forbid it. But there are general policies observed in all bingo houses, such as disqualification of tampered bingo cards. There is no way you can get away with a tampered card because the walkers are adept at identifying authentic cards from tampered ones. You could be banned from a bingo establishment if proven liable of tampering a card. Hence, you should play honestly. Interestingly, some venues offer special bingo games for kids although some halls don't allow players to have companions while playing. Suppose you bring kids with you, don't let them run around the venue and bother other gamers. They should behave well whilst you play and the game proceeds. Play quietly and don't recite the numbers you desperately want to come off because you'll be much of a disturbance if you do. Decorous playing is expectant of all players, even those who play roulette at casinos. Also, having a valid identification is important because you don't know you might win and need to present credentials.

The relative difficulties of men's and women's fashion  Both women and men can have the difficulties of keeping their wardrobe up-to-date and in season, yet men's fashion frequently seems a lot easier. Of program, for both genders, outfits and style options could be equally as intricate, and there are numerous'stylish'items that can easily become fashion faux pas - who will say they frequently see people travelling in 70s flames? On the other side, men's style includes a few choice things that can exist eternally - which man is likely to keep an eye out of place with a good-quality, tailored suit, for example? Pick classic pieces, colours and fabrics and you'll never look out-of-place.  Why basic men's fashion is timeless  The basic man's suit has hardly changed for over a hundred years. True, there are numerous varieties for different events, but they are all popular in their pursuit of a wise, sharp search for the wearer. The great thing about common style for men is that it's effortlessly fashionable effectively cool. A well-groomed man will almost always appear his sharpest in a well-tailored suit, and this can be a testament to the style of such apparel. A suit will undoubtedly be utilized to work in several occupations due to the professional look it offers to the wearer, instilling a sense of respect and trust. Similarly a suit will undoubtedly be utilized to several social occasions, such as a tuxedo to a black-tie affair. This amazing versatility that allows matches to be worn in just about all occasions is what gives it its classic border and a lasting invest men's fashion.  Contemporary developments in classic men's style  Although common men's designs will never be changed, it is interesting to note that shifts in men's fashion trends have brought particular common garments back into fashion. The acceptance of vintage clothing, specifically, has brought back a wide-variety of basic models into men's wardrobes, such as that of the dandy guy. 'Dandy'is a term used to refer to men who dress yourself in a classic yet elegant way, working in a refined manner and placing value on appearance. This pattern for almost'over-the-top'classic fashion for men is evident from events including the'Tweed Run', where men and women of all ages clothe themselves in especially Victorian-style attire and take to the streets on vintage cycles - with most of the men sporting remarkable mustaches! This really is only one of many examples of proof showing the resurgence of such variations. Additionally, there are numerous sites online which concentrate on gentlemanly type - such as'The Dandy Project'and'Dandyism'- as well as complete sites such as'The Art of Manliness'dedicated to giving articles on traditional men's fashion and grooming.  In conclusion, although certain facets of common men's fashion may be cut back as new developments, the fundamental outfits that they derive from will never slip out of fashion.
